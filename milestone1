 Milestone 1 â€“ Tools, technologies, and process plan 
Identify key tools, technologies, technical skills, and processes that you will be 
depending  on  throughout  the  rest  of  the  project.  Process  should  not  only  include  the 
traditional  aspects  of  a  software  process,  but  any  kind  of  process  you  feel  you need  to 
adopt  to  be  successful.  Your  team  will  deliver  a  PDF  describing  all  these  information, 
including the justification of why the software process is chosen for your project.
